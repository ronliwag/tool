# LOCAL TESTING PLAN - MODIFIED STREAMSPEECH

## üéØ **WHAT WE CAN TEST RIGHT NOW (Without Colab Pro)**

Since we're waiting for Colab Pro payment, let's thoroughly test and improve the modified system locally:

### **PHASE 1: DIAGNOSTIC TESTING (30 minutes)**
1. **Test Enhanced Desktop App**
   - Launch the desktop application
   - Test with Spanish audio samples
   - Compare Original vs Modified modes
   - Document any buzz sounds or issues

2. **Test StreamSpeech Integration**
   - Verify StreamSpeech is working properly
   - Check if English audio is generated (not zeros)
   - Test with different Spanish samples

3. **Test Modified Components**
   - Check if modified HiFi-GAN is being used
   - Verify speaker/emotion embeddings are extracted
   - Test voice cloning pipeline

### **PHASE 2: FIX LOCAL ISSUES (45 minutes)**
1. **Fix Buzz Sound Issues**
   - Use the diagnostic tools we created
   - Apply fixes from `fixed_streamspeech_integration.py`
   - Test with real Spanish audio samples

2. **Improve Integration Pipeline**
   - Ensure modified components are actually used
   - Fix any architecture mismatches
   - Optimize for local hardware

3. **Create Test Audio Samples**
   - Generate test Spanish audio files
   - Test with different speakers and emotions
   - Document results

### **PHASE 3: LOCAL TRAINING PREPARATION (30 minutes)**
1. **Prepare Dataset**
   - Use the real CVSS-T dataset we have
   - Create smaller training batches for local testing
   - Verify data preprocessing

2. **Test Training Components**
   - Test ECAPA-TDNN extractor locally
   - Test Emotion2Vec extractor locally
   - Verify all components work together

3. **Local Mini-Training**
   - Run a small training session (1-2 epochs)
   - Test with reduced dataset size
   - Verify training pipeline works

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

### **Step 1: Test Enhanced Desktop App**
```bash
cd "Original Streamspeech/Modified Streamspeech/demo"
python enhanced_desktop_app.py
```

### **Step 2: Test with Spanish Audio**
- Upload Spanish audio samples
- Test both Original and Modified modes
- Document differences and issues

### **Step 3: Fix Integration Issues**
- Use `fixed_streamspeech_integration.py`
- Apply buzz sound fixes
- Test with real audio

## üìã **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Desktop App Testing:**
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Spanish audio upload works
- [ ] Original mode produces English audio
- [ ] Modified mode produces English audio
- [ ] No buzz sounds in Modified mode
- [ ] Audio quality is acceptable
- [ ] Translation accuracy is good

### **Integration Testing:**
- [ ] StreamSpeech initializes properly
- [ ] Modified HiFi-GAN is loaded
- [ ] Speaker embeddings are extracted
- [ ] Emotion embeddings are extracted
- [ ] Voice cloning pipeline works
- [ ] Output audio is clear and natural

### **Performance Testing:**
- [ ] Processing time is reasonable
- [ ] Memory usage is acceptable
- [ ] GPU is utilized (if available)
- [ ] No crashes or errors

## üéØ **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### **Success Criteria:**
1. **No Buzz Sounds**: Modified mode produces clear English audio
2. **Voice Cloning**: Output preserves Spanish speaker characteristics
3. **Translation Quality**: English output is accurate and natural
4. **Performance**: Processing is reasonably fast
5. **Stability**: No crashes or errors

### **If Issues Found:**
1. **Buzz Sounds**: Apply fixes from diagnostic tools
2. **No English Output**: Fix StreamSpeech integration
3. **Poor Quality**: Improve modified components
4. **Performance Issues**: Optimize for local hardware

## üìù **DOCUMENTATION**

Document all findings:
- Test results and issues
- Performance metrics
- Audio quality assessments
- Recommendations for Colab training

## üöÄ **READY FOR COLAB**

Once local testing is complete:
1. All issues are identified and fixed
2. Integration pipeline is working
3. Training components are verified
4. Ready for professional Colab training

**This ensures we make the most of Colab Pro when it's available!**
