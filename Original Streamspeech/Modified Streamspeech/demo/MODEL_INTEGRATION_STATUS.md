# MODEL INTEGRATION STATUS

## ðŸš¨ **Current Issue: Modified HiFi-GAN Not Being Used**

### **Problem Identified:**
The desktop application is currently using the **original StreamSpeech agents** for both Original and Modified modes. Your thesis modifications (ODConv, GRC+LoRA, FiLM) are not actually being applied to the audio processing.

### **What's Happening Now:**
1. **Original Mode**: Uses original StreamSpeech (correct)
2. **Modified Mode**: Still uses original StreamSpeech (incorrect - should use your modified HiFi-GAN)

### **Why Audio Sounds the Same:**
Both modes are using the same underlying vocoder, so there's no audible difference. The modifications exist in your code but aren't integrated into the actual processing pipeline.

### **What Needs to Be Done:**
1. **Integrate Modified HiFi-GAN**: Replace the original vocoder with your `ModifiedHiFiGANGenerator`
2. **Add Speaker/Emotion Embedding Extraction**: Implement ECAPA-TDNN and Emotion2Vec
3. **Connect FiLM Conditioning**: Ensure speaker/emotion embeddings are passed to the vocoder
4. **Update Processing Pipeline**: Modify the audio processing to use your enhanced components

### **Files That Need Integration:**
- `models/modified_hifigan.py` - Your modified HiFi-GAN implementation
- `evaluation/thesis_metrics.py` - Your evaluation metrics
- `integration/thesis_integration.py` - Integration demonstration

### **Next Steps:**
1. Create a proper modified StreamSpeech agent that uses your HiFi-GAN
2. Integrate speaker/emotion embedding extraction
3. Connect the FiLM conditioning pipeline
4. Test with actual audio to hear the differences

### **Expected Results After Integration:**
- **Modified Mode**: Should produce more natural, expressive English speech
- **Speaker Identity**: Should preserve the original speaker's voice characteristics
- **Emotional Tone**: Should maintain the emotional content from the input
- **Quality**: Should be noticeably higher quality than Original mode

The current system is a comparison framework, but the actual thesis modifications need to be integrated into the processing pipeline to see real differences.
