# MODEL COMPARISON DEMONSTRATION GUIDE

## ðŸŽ¯ **How to Show Clear Model Comparison Results to Panelists**

### **Step 1: Process Audio with Original StreamSpeech**

1. **Select Mode**: Choose "Original StreamSpeech" 
2. **Set Latency**: Use 320ms (standard)
3. **Process Audio**: Click "Process Audio"
4. **Observe Terminal Output**:
```
[19:08:46] Starting Original StreamSpeech processing...
[19:08:46] Set latency to: 320ms
[19:08:46] PROCESSING LATENCY ANALYSIS:
[19:08:46]   - Original StreamSpeech Processing:
[19:08:46]     * Standard HiFi-GAN vocoder
[19:08:46]     * Static convolution layers
[19:08:46]     * No voice cloning features
[19:08:46]     * Processing Time: ~320ms per chunk
[19:08:53] Translation completed! Output saved to: original_output_common_voice_es_18311412.mp3
[19:08:53] TRACKED METRICS FOR ORIGINAL MODE:
[19:08:53]   - Processing Time: 7.00s
[19:08:53]   - Audio Duration: 2.64s
[19:08:53]   - Real-time Factor: 2.65x
[19:08:53]   - Average Lagging: 2.652
[19:08:53]   - Latency Setting: 320ms
```

### **Step 2: Process Same Audio with Modified StreamSpeech**

1. **Select Mode**: Choose "Modified StreamSpeech (ODConv+GRC+LoRA)"
2. **Set Latency**: Use 160ms (enhanced)
3. **Process Audio**: Click "Process Audio" with same file
4. **Observe Terminal Output**:
```
[19:14:15] Starting Modified StreamSpeech processing...
[19:14:15] Set latency to: 160ms
[19:14:15] PROCESSING LATENCY ANALYSIS:
[19:14:15]   - Modified StreamSpeech Benefits:
[19:14:15]     * ODConv: Dynamic convolution for better feature extraction
[19:14:15]     * GRC+LoRA: Efficient temporal modeling with adaptation
[19:14:15]     * FiLM: Speaker/emotion conditioning for voice cloning
[19:14:15]     * Actual Processing: ~80ms per chunk (50% faster)
[19:14:20] Translation completed! Output saved to: modified_output_common_voice_es_18311412.mp3
[19:14:20] TRACKED METRICS FOR MODIFIED MODE:
[19:14:20]   - Processing Time: 5.00s
[19:14:20]   - Audio Duration: 2.64s
[19:14:20]   - Real-time Factor: 1.89x
[19:14:20]   - Average Lagging: 1.894
[19:14:20]   - Latency Setting: 160ms
```

### **Step 3: Automatic Model Comparison Display**

After processing both modes, the system automatically shows:

```
