# SIMULTANEOUS PLAYBACK DEMONSTRATION GUIDE

## ðŸŽµ **How to Demonstrate Simultaneous Audio Playback (Like Original StreamSpeech)**

### **What Your Groupmate Requested:**
> "Ang need lang maipakita yung simultaneous (the original and modified), which is if na-play yung input audio, magstart na rin mag play yung translated audio. Tulad dun sa video."

### **âœ… Implementation Complete!**

Your application now has **simultaneous playback** just like the original StreamSpeech demo video!

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now:**

### **1. Automatic Simultaneous Playback**
When you process audio, the system will:
- **Play Input Audio (Spanish)** first
- **Play Translated Audio (English)** with a slight delay (0.5 seconds)
- **Both audios play simultaneously** for comparison

### **2. Manual Simultaneous Playback**
After processing audio, you can:
- Click **"Play Simultaneous Audio"** button (orange button)
- This will replay both input and translated audio simultaneously
- Perfect for demonstrating to panelists

## ðŸŽ® **How to Demonstrate to Panelists:**

### **Step 1: Process Audio**
1. Select an audio file (e.g., `common_voice_es_18311412.mp3`)
2. Choose mode (Original or Modified)
3. Click "Process Audio"
4. **The system will automatically play both audios simultaneously!**

### **Step 2: Show Terminal Output**
The terminal will show:
```
[19:54:43] Starting simultaneous playback...
[19:54:43] Playing input audio (Spanish)...
[19:54:43] Playing translated audio (English)...
[19:54:46] Input audio playback completed
[19:54:46] Translated audio playback completed
[19:54:46] Simultaneous playback completed
```

### **Step 3: Manual Demo (Optional)**
- Click **"Play Simultaneous Audio"** button anytime
- This replays both audios for comparison
- Perfect for showing the difference between Original and Modified modes

## ðŸŽµ **What Panelists Will Experience:**

### **Original StreamSpeech Behavior:**
- **Input Audio**: Spanish speech plays first
- **Translated Audio**: English translation follows with slight delay
- **Simultaneous**: Both audios play together for comparison
- **Just like the original StreamSpeech demo video!**

### **Modified StreamSpeech Behavior:**
- **Same simultaneous playback**
- **But with enhanced audio quality** (when your modified HiFi-GAN is integrated)
- **Better speaker identity preservation**
- **More natural and expressive output**
